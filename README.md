## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need to have Python and PyTorch installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* PyTorch
* Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SID41214/Neural-Network-And-PyTorch.git](https://github.com/SID41214/Neural-Network-And-PyTorch.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Neural-Network-And-PyTorch
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a Jupyter Notebook or Python script. To run a project, navigate to its directory and launch the notebook or script.

For example, to run the Basic Neural Network project:

```bash
cd "Basic Neural Network"
jupyter notebook "Basic_NN.ipynb"
```

## ü§ù Contributing
